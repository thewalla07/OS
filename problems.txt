1. All the typed commands, apart from resume, experience a slight delay because because line.write() blocks until it has fully written the audio. This causes the delay when the other commands are entered.

2. The TextField does not clear after a command is entered. We tried using textfield.setText("") but it did not work. If a space is used i.e. textfield.setText(" "), it works, but you are required to delete the space before entering another command.
